Solaar
------


This application connects to a Logitech Unifying Receiver
(http://www.logitech.com/en-us/66/6079) and listens for events from devices
attached to it.

Currently the K750 solar keyboard is also queried for its solar charge status.
Support for other devices could be added in the future, but the K750 keyboard is
the only device I have and can test on.

Pairing and un-pairing of devices is planned, but not implemented at this time.


Requirements
------------

- Python (2.7 or 3.2).
- Gtk 3; Gtk 2 should partially work with some problems.
- Python GI (GObject Introspection), for Gtk bindings.
- pyudev for enumerating udev devices.
- Optional libnotify GI bindings, for desktop notifications.


Installation
------------

Normally USB devices are not accessible for r/w by regular users, so you will
need to install a udev rule to allow access to the Logitech Unifying Receiver.

In rules.d/ you'll find a udev rule file, to be copied in /etc/udev/rules.d/ (as
root).

In its current form it makes the UR device available for r/w by all users
belonging to the 'plugdev' system group (standard Debian group for pluggable
devices). It may need changes, specific to your particular system's
configuration.

If in doubt, replacing GROUP="plugdev" with GROUP="<your username>" should just
work.

This project began as a third-hand clone of Noah K. Tilton's logitech-solar-k750
project on GitHub (no longer available). It was developed further thanks to the
diggings in Logitech's HID protocol done, among others, by Julien Danjou
(http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/logitech-k750-linux-support) and
Lars-Dominik Braun (http://6xq.net/git/lars/lshidpp.git).
