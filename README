Solaar


This application connects to a Logitech Unifying Receiver and puts an icon in
the systray that watches for events from devices attached to it.

Currently the K750 solar keyboard is also queried for its solar charge status.
Other devices can also be added in the future (the K750 keyboard is the only
device I have and can test on).

Requirements:
	- Python 2 or 3
	- A hidapi native implementation (see lib/hidapi.py for details).
	- Optional python-notify2 for desktop notifications.


This project began as a third-hand clone of Noah K. Tilton's logitech-solar-k750
project on GitHub (no longer available). It was developed further thanks to the
diggings in Logitech's HID protocol done by Julien Danjou
(http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/logitech-k750-linux-support) and
Lars-Dominik Braun (http://6xq.net/git/lars/lshidpp.git).
