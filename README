Solaar
------


This application connects to a Logitech Unifying Receiver
(http://www.logitech.com/en-us/66/6079) and listens for events from devices
attached to it.

Currently the K750 solar keyboard is also queried for its solar charge status.
Support for other devices could be added in the future, but the K750 keyboard is
the only device I have and can test on.

Pairing and un-pairing of devices is planned, but not implemented at this time.


Requirements
------------

- Python (2.7 or 3.2).
- Gtk 3; Gtk 2 should partially work with some problems.
- Python GI (GObject Introspection), for Gtk bindings.
- Optional libnotify GI bindings, for desktop notifications.
- A hidapi native implementation (see the INSTALL file for details).

This project began as a third-hand clone of Noah K. Tilton's logitech-solar-k750
project on GitHub (no longer available). It was developed further thanks to the
diggings in Logitech's HID protocol done, among others, by Julien Danjou
(http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/logitech-k750-linux-support) and
Lars-Dominik Braun (http://6xq.net/git/lars/lshidpp.git).
