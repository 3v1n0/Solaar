+++ Logitech Solar k750 Userspace "Driver" for Linux

Userspace driver for Logitech solar-powered (photovaltic) keyboard.
Predictably, Logitech provides Windoze and Crackintosh versions of its
software, but no Linux drivers.

Alas, I am not a hardware hacker but I spent some time reading the USB
spec and wireshark usb packet dumps (did you know libpcap is compatible
with USB? I didn't!) and fuzzing the hardware with hex values using
pyusb.  To my surprise, it kinda works.

Note:  drop the udev rule in ./rules.d into your distro's custom rules
directory (presently /etc/udev/rules.d/ on Archlinux).  May require
editing/rebooting; YMMV.
