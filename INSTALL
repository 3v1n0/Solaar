Installation
------------


1. Make the Logitech Unifying Receiver device available to standard users

Normally USB devices are not accessible for r/w by regular users.

In rules.d/ you'll find a udev rule file, to be copied in /etc/udev/rules.d/ (as
root).

In its current form it makes the UR device available for r/w by all users
belonging to the 'plugdev' system group (standard Debian group for pluggable
devices). It may need changes, specific to your particular system's
configuration.

If in doubt, replacing GROUP="plugdev" with GROUP="<your username>" should just
work.


2. Compile the hidapi native library.

Solaar uses a thin ctypes layer on top of a native hidapi library to talk
directly to the UR device. Its source code is available here:
https://github.com/signal11/hidapi .

The native library comes in two flavors, `hidraw` and `libusb`. You should
compile and use the hidraw implementation (in linux/); the libusb version
disconnects the device from the kernel and may cause your UR-connected devices
to stop working until you physically remove and re-insert the UR.

Once compiled, you should copy the shared library (libhidapi-hidraw.so) to the
lib/native/ directory appropiate for your machine (most likely x86_64).


3. Start the application with ./bin/solaar
