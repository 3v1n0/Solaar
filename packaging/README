The debian/ and ubuntu/ folders are maintained by me and used for all releases
for those respective distros.

The rest of the files serve as samples/guidelines for packaging Solaar.
They may be out-of-date or simply wrong, and are not necessarily used to build
the official packages.

See README.md for links to official packages for various distributions.
