# Initially copied from signal11/hidapi/udev, with modifications.

# This is a sample udev file for HIDAPI devices which changes the permissions
# to 0660 and group to plugdev for a specified device on Linux systems.

# Make sure the plugdev group exists on your system and your user is a member
# before applying these rules.


# If you are using the libusb implementation of hidapi (hid-libusb.c), then
# use something like the following line, substituting the VID and PID with
# those of your device. Note that for kernels before 2.6.24, you will need
# to substitute "usb" with "usb_device". It shouldn't hurt to use two lines
# (one each way) for compatibility with older systems.

# HIDAPI/libusb
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="046d", ATTR{idProduct}=="c52b", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0660"

# If you are using the hidraw implementation, then do something like the
# following, substituting the VID and PID with your device.

# HIDAPI/hidraw
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="046d", ATTRS{idProduct}=="c52b", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0660"
